I wanted to create a blog for a long time, but I never knew what to write about and I always felt like it would be too much of a hassle.
In December last year, I heard about [GitHub pages][GitHub pages]{:target="_blank"} for the first time and I had a quick look at its documentation. It seemed easy to set up and easy to use, so I had one less excuse to create a blog.

I am still not sure about what I am going to write about, it will probably be about the books I am reading and the projects I am working on.
In the end, the main goal is to try something new, improve my writing skills and have something I can look back and be proud of.
